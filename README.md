# Cypress Installation and Setup Guide

## Step 1: Install Node.js
Cypress requires Node.js to run. If you don't have it installed, download and install it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Step 2: Create a New Project (Optional)
If you don't have a project yet, you can create a new directory for your Cypress project:

```bash
mkdir my-cypress-project
cd my-cypress-project
npm init -y

## Step 3: Install Cypress
To install Cypress as a dev dependency, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install cypress --save-dev
```

## Step 4: Open Cypress
Once installed, you can open Cypress by running:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

This will launch the Cypress Test Runner in your default browser.

## Step 5: Run Cypress Tests
After Cypress is open, you can run the tests in two ways:

- **Interactive Mode (GUI):**
  Choose a browser and run the tests interactively.

- **Headless Mode (Terminal):**
  Run the tests from the terminal by executing:

  ```bash
  npx cypress run
  ```

## Step 6: Write Tests
Cypress tests are written in JavaScript. By default, sample tests are located in the `cypress/integration` folder. You can either modify existing tests or create new ones.

## Additional Configuration
You can configure Cypress settings in the `cypress.json` file located in your project root. This allows you to customize settings such as the base URL, environment variables, and other configurations.
